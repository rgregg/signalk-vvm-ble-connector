# Vessel View Mobile to Signal K

This project is a reverse engineering effort for the Mercury Vessel View Mobile application. I wanted to be able
to receive the data from the VVM via Bluetooth into a Raspberry Pi 4 that I had installed as a boat computer.

The application integrates with the SignalK API to publish data received from the Vessel View Mobile devices
into a Signal K server, which can then send the data to other devices connected to the network.
